    <p>Nasi goreng is a classic Indonesian fried rice dish made<br>with day-old rice, sweet soy sauce, eggs, and simple<br>aromatics like onion and garlic. Quick to prepare in one pan,<br>itâ€™s a flavorful and comforting meal that can be<br>customized with chicken, shrimp, or vegetables,<br>and traditionally topped with a fried egg and crunchy prawn crackers.</p>
