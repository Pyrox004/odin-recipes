    <h1>Odin Recipes</h1>
    <p>I’ve put together three recipes that reflect my love for different food cultures.<br><br>
  I started with a poké bowl, fresh and colorful, perfect for a healthy and balanced meal.<br>
  Then I made nasi goreng, simple but full of flavor, a classic comfort dish from Indonesia.<br>
  Finally, I created a recipe for Yemeni mandi, rich and aromatic, a dish that carries a sense of tradition and celebration.<br><br>
  By making these, I wanted to explore variety, from light and modern to deep and traditional, and show how cooking can connect different worlds on one table.</p>
